# Chess Opening Recommendation System

## Description
This project builds an end-to-end recommendation system that classifies chess openings into broad play-style categories. The system is based on:

- Opening move data (ECO codes and statistics)
- Real-world game dataset
- Live Chess.com API data for real-time prediction
- Random Forest model for classification
